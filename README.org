#+TITLE: ppx_metaquot
#+PARENT: ../README.md

Ppx\_metaquot is a ppx rewriter allowing you to write values
representing the OCaml AST in the OCaml syntax.

For instance:

#+begin_src ocaml
[%expr x + 1]
#+end_src

is a value of type =Ppx_ast.Ast.expression=, represention the OCaml
expression =x + 1=.

Ppx\_metaquot is similar to [[https://github.com/alainfrisch/ppx_tools][ppx_tools.metaquot]] expect that:
-  it uses the version of the OCaml AST defined by Ppx\_ast rather
   than the one from the current compiler
- it can be used simultaneously with other rewriters using [[https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_driver][Ppx_driver]]
